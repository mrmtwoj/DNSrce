# DNSrce
A simple DNS-based remote command execution (RCE) tool that allows a client to send commands to a server using DNS queries. The tool encrypts the commands, sends them to the server, and then decrypts the server's response. This tool is built with Python and uses DNS for communication between the client and the server.
